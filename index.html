    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Shubh Arora — a curious learner who loves coding, debugging, and solving problems with logic and creativity. From C++ 	programs and data structures to converting complex problems to much simpler ones, I enjoy breaking concepts down and understanding 	how things work.

	I learn fast, ask the right questions, and always look for simple, clear solutions. If you need someone who’s reliable, 	analytical, and always improving — that’s me.
    </p>
    <h2>Achivements</h2>
        <p><h3>DSA Competition Achievement</h3>

	Participating in a DSA competition was a major milestone in my learning journey. It challenged me to apply logic, optimize under 	pressure, 	and think beyond textbook solutions. Solving complex problems in a competitive environment strengthened my 	understanding of algorithms, improved my coding speed, and boosted my confidence as a programmer.

	This experience not only sharpened my technical skills but also proved my ability to stay focused and perform under time 	constraints—making it an achievement I’m genuinely proud of..</p>
<p><h3>Google Cloud Study Jam</h3>

	Participating in the Google Cloud Study Jam was a valuable learning experience where I explored core cloud concepts, hands-on 	labs, and real-world applications of Google Cloud services. It strengthened my understanding of cloud computing, improved my 	practical problem-solving skills, and helped me build a foundation in modern cloud technologies. This achievement reflects my 	interest in continuous learning and staying updated with industry-relevant skills.
